# Security Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the security policy for the [Engineer StudyHub](https://engineerstudyhub.in/) open source project, which provides dynamic platform that empowers engineering students with hands-on learning through tutorials, projects, and coding challenges. Focused on bridging the gap between academics and industry, it offers collaborative resources and mentorship to help students gain practical skills and real-world expertise. The policy is intended to provide guidelines and procedures for reporting, triaging, and addressing security vulnerabilities in the project.

## Scope

The security policy covers the codebase and documentation of the open-source project, as well as any external links to resources, including tutorials and other educational materials.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

The project will provide a dedicated email address (info@engineerstudyhub.in) for submitting vulnerability reports related to the [Engineer StudyHub](https://engineerstudyhub.in/) platform or any of the linked resources. Vulnerability reports will be reviewed and triaged by the project's maintainers. The owner will aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours and will provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability and any remediation efforts.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The maintainers are responsible for handling vulnerability reports and making decisions about how to address them. They will also work with contributors and external resource owners to resolve the issue(s) as quickly as possible.

## Response Timeline

Engineer StudyHub will aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and non-critical vulnerabilities within 90 days. These deadlines may extend if additional time is needed to address the issue(s).

## Secure Coding Practices

Engineer StudyHub will guide secure coding practices for contributors, including guidelines for input validation, authentication, authorization, and data protection.

## Regular Review and Update

The security policy will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it remains effective and relevant. The maintainers will evaluate the vulnerability disclosure process, update secure coding guidelines, and revise the response timeline as needed.

## Disclosure Policy

Engineer StudyHub will follow a coordinated disclosure policy, which means that vulnerabilities will be disclosed publicly only after they have been remediated. The project may work with external resource owners to coordinate the disclosure of vulnerabilities that affect their websites or content.

## Legal Disclaimer

The security policy includes a legal disclaimer that limits the liability of the project maintainers and contributors for any security vulnerabilities or incidents that occur as a result of using [Engineer StudyHub](https://engineerstudyhub.in/) website or any of the linked resources.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about the security policy or any security vulnerabilities in the project, please contact us at _info@engineerstudyhub.in_.

By implementing this security policy, we aim to ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and that users and contributors can use [Engineer StudyHub](https://engineerstudyhub.in/) and its linked resources safely and securely.
